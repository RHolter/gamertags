      <p class="text-white">Duck Hunt[a] is a 1984 light gun shooter video game developed and published by Nintendo for the
        Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game console and the Nintendo Vs. System arcade hardware. The game was
        first released in April 1984, in Japan for the Family Computer (Famicom) console and in North America as an arcade
        game. It was then released as a launch game for the NES in North America in October 1985, with it also releasing
        in Europe two years later.  </p>

      <img src="images/HA_cover.jpg" class="game" id="nintendo" alt="Hogan's Alley">
      <p class="text-white">The name of the game was likely taken from an old comic in the 19th Century called The Yellow
        Kid, a.k.a Hogan's Alley. It was then used by the FBI to describe their training program in Quantico, Virginia,
        where one test trainees must undergo is walking through a simulated town where paper targets randomly appear.
        This training course was called a "Hogan's Alley" after the old comic</p>

      <img src="images/SMB_box.png" class="game" id="nintendo" id="nintendo" alt="Super Mario Brothers">
      <p class="text-white">A successor to the 1983 arcade video game Mario Bros., the game was perhaps as popular as it
        was due to the increasing fanbase of gamers who immensely enjoyed titles like Donkey Kong and, naturally,
        Mario Bros. The Nintendo Entertainment System's success in America can arguably be attributed to the video game,
        and certainly it helped increase the sales of the Famicom in Japan.  </p>

      <img src="images/loz_cover.jpg" class="game" id="nintendo" alt="Legend of Zelda ">
      <p class="text-white">The Legend of Zelda games feature a mix of puzzles, action, adventure/battle gameplay, and
        exploration. These elements have remained constant throughout the series, but with refinements and additions featured
        in each new game. Later games in the series also include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while
        proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of
        exploration and side quests, the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving
        puzzles or exploring hidden areas.</p>

      <img src="images/tetris.png"  class="game" id="nintendo" alt="Tetries">
      <p class="text-white">In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend
        onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill
        the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this outcome,
        the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, players must last longer than their opponents; in certain versions,
        players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some versions add variations
        on the rules, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces. </p>

      <img src="images/FF1_USA_boxart.jpg "  class="game" id="nintendo" alt="Final Fantasy">
      <p class="text-white">Final Fantasy takes place in a fantasy world with three large continents. The elemental powers
        of this world are determined by the state of four crystals, each governing one of the four classical elements:
        earth, fire, water, and wind. The world of Final Fantasy is inhabited by numerous races, including humans, elves,
        dwarves, mermaids, dragons, and robots. Most non-human races have only one "town" in the game, although individuals
        are sometimes found in human towns or other areas as well</p>
