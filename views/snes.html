                Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game console and the Nintendo Vs. System arcade hardware. The game was
                first released in April 1984, in Japan for the Family Computer (Famicom) console and in North America as an arcade
                game. It was then released as a launch game for the NES in North America in October 1985, with it also releasing
                in Europe two years later.</textarea>

                was due to the increasing fanbase of gamers who immensely enjoyed titles like Donkey Kong and, naturally,
                Mario Bros. The Nintendo Entertainment System's success in America can arguably be attributed to the video game,
                and certainly it helped increase the sales of the Famicom in Japan.</textarea>

                exploration. These elements have remained constant throughout the series, but with refinements and additions featured
                in each new game. Later games in the series also include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while
                proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of
                exploration and side quests, the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving
                puzzles or exploring hidden areas.</textarea>

                onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill
                the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this outcome,
                the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, players must last longer than their opponents; in certain versions,
                players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some versions add variations
                on the rules, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces.</textarea>
