                Card Master to perish during Elemen's civil war, who was also one of the Knights of Lexford. The death of his father
                  motivated Rooks to begin learning the art of the cards in earnest, but in a decade his minimal training has barely
                scratched the surface when word comes to his home village of Galia. Mysterious events are occurring all over the
                land, heralding a cataclysm. Rooks' path lies before him as he sets off to prevent the awakening of Rimsala, so
                he must fulfill his destiny as the last Card Master before it is too late.</textarea>

                Destroying monster lairs in the dungeons causes a soul belonging to a former town occupant to be liberated and reincarnated.
                This is often a human, but it could be anything from a dolphin to a talking tulip. As souls are freed, the town is
                reconstructed around the people. The new town occupants give the player advice and items. When the player defeats the boss
                monster imprisoning the soul of the head of each town, the area is cleared and the player can continue. After the hero frees
                the first six villages, he is granted access to the "World of Evil", where the final villain awaits.</textarea>
