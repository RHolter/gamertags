                fictional land of Nosgoth and slaughtering the Circle of Nine, a corrupt oligarchy of godlike sorcerers, but
                slowly begins to forsake humanity and view his transformation as a blessing. </p>

            <p class="text-white">The game begins as a wanderer named Bartz investigates a fallen meteor. There, he encounters
                several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements.
                These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. Bartz and his party must keep the Crystals from being
                exploited by Exdeath's influence and prevent his resurgence </p>

            <p class="text-white">The story takes place after Ivalice ended its war with the two nations in what is known
                as the Fifty Years War, and is facing economic problems and political strife. The king of Ivalice has recently
                died and his heir is an infant, so a regent is needed to rule in place of the prince. The kingdom is split
                between two candidates named Prince Goltana, represented by the Black Lion, and Prince Larg, symbolized by
                the White Lion. The conflict leads to what is known in the game as the Lion War. Behind this backdrop is
                a revelation by the game's historian Alazlam J. Durai, who seeks to reveal the story of an unknown character
                whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom's church </p>
