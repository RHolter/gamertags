                several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements.

            <p class="text-white">The story takes place after Ivalice ended its war with the two nations in what is known
                as the Fifty Years War, and is facing economic problems and political strife. The king of Ivalice has recently
                died and his heir is an infant, so a regent is needed to rule in place of the prince. The kingdom is split
                between two candidates named Prince Goltana, represented by the Black Lion, and Prince Larg, symbolized by
                the White Lion. The conflict leads to what is known in the game as the Lion War. Behind this backdrop is
                a revelation by the game's historian Alazlam J. Durai, who seeks to reveal the story of an unknown character
                whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom's church </p>

                Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose
                the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.</p>

            <p class="text-white">Grand Theft Auto is made up of six levels split between three main cities; each locale
                is based on a real-life city in the United States, with an alternative name: Liberty City (New York City),
                San Andreas (San Francisco), and Vice City (Miami). The progression is linear, as each level completed
                automatically unlocks the next one in the chain. Players begin a game choosing a character from amongst
                eight</p>
